             <p class="py-4"><b>What is PMS? </b>PMS or Premenstrual Syndrome is a set of physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms that occur during the latter part of the menstrual cycle of a woman, mostly around a week or two prior to the period. Premenstrual symptoms are different for different women. Some women feel little to no discomfort apart from slightly tender breasts or a sweet craving during the days leading up to their periods. But many women experience several physical changes such as tender breasts, bloating, severe fatigue, and several behavioral and emotional changes such as extreme mood swings, irritability, and bouts of sadness.</p>


             <p><b>What are the symptoms of PMS?</b>Even though every woman experiences PMS differently, right from the PMS duration to its severity and symptoms, there are a set of common physical and emotional symptoms that have been attributed to PMS.Physical signs and symptoms of PMS include but are not limited to bloating, PMS cramps, fatigue, joint pain, hunger pangs, acne, a disturbed sleep schedule etc. While the emotional symptoms can manifest themselves in the form of oversensitivity, extreme mood swings, anger, irritability, anxiety, depression, etc. 

             Physical signs and symptoms: Joint or muscle pain, Headache,Fatigue, Weight gain related to fluid retention,Abdominal bloating, Breast tenderness.

                <p class="py-4"><b>Causes of PMS : </b>Even though it is estimated that three out of four women experience PMS symptoms in some or the other form, the exact causes of PMS are unknown. That being said, several studies suggest that PMS is mainly caused due changes in cyclic hormones during your menstrual cycle. The interaction between the hormones and serotonin, a chemical produced by the brain that is responsible for your mood states, is also considered to be a contributing factor.A few other factors such as smoking, stress, alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, depression etc., are also known to affect PMS and its severity, however, they do not cause it.
</p>

              <p><b> When to see a doctor?</b> As a general rule, it is best you paid a visit to your gynecologist if the PMS symptoms begin to interfere with your daily life, causing issues at work or affecting your interpersonal relationships.You have tried home remedies such as lifestyle changes and stress management techniques but to no avail.If you have recurring symptoms of PMS that are severe enough to affect your daily routine, prior to your periods, for over three months.Deciding when to visit your doctor can prove to be slightly tricky since the symptoms of PMS are largely similar to the early symptoms of pregnancy and other disorders. An effective tool that can help here is maintaining a menstrual record. </p>
