             <p class="py-4"><b>WATER IS YOUR FRIEND:  </b> It might seem odd that you need to drink more water when you're feeling the most bloated, puffy and full, but the more water you drink, the better. There’s no specific recommendation of how much water each unique person should drink but a common guideline is to drink eight to ten 8-ounce glasses of water throughout the day. If you’re on-the-go, be sure to carry a water bottle with you and try to fill it up several times throughout the day.</p> </p>

             <p><b>EAT HEALTHY FOODS : </b>If you’re looking for what kind of food to eat on your period, then try reaching for healthier snacks like fruits and veggies or other low sodium foods that won’t make you balloon. Avoid eating processed foods and too much salt, your belly will thank you later. Processed foods can contain high amounts of salt and contribute to increased bloating, no thank you! Other safe bets for healthy eating are proteins like fish and chicken and healthy fats, like nuts and avocados.</p>

                <p class="py-4"><b>AVOID CAFFEINE </b> Caffeine can also irritate your stomach and give you that achy, crampy, bloated feeling, so it's best to limit your intake on your period. In addition to caffeine, it’s a good idea to avoid sweet and carbonated drinks that can also increase bloating. A good caffeine-free drink option is herbal tea. Get a cup of hot tea (i.e. ginger, green tea, peppermint, chamomile, raspberry leaf) to reduce bloating and feel better on your period.</p>

              <p><b>GET IN SOME EXERCISE : </b>Yes, this is probably the last thing you want to do. We get it. But, light exercise during your period can help increase your blood flow which can help alleviate period symptoms like bloating.</p>
                
               <p><b>GET PLENTY OF ZZZ's : </b> Period fatigue is real and it can be further impacted by period pain. If you’re feeling tired during your period, getting good rest can help your body and mind repair. Aim to get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, especially while on your period.</p>
