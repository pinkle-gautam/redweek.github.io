So basically period cramps are more like angry little ninjas inside you trying to kill you.
Cramping in the lower abdomen, usually in the first or second day of the menstrual cycle, that is caused
by contractions of the uterus as it expels its unneeded contents and by the passage of clotted blood
through the cervix
Oh, there is nothing more dreadful than the monthly period cramps, but we assure, there’s nothing to
fear at all. For most women, the pain though frustrating can be bearable, but for some others, it can get
in the way of their daily activities. You must understand that it is important to treat health conditions that
cause severe period cramps, while the menstrual cramps without any serious condition tend to reduce
with age and often after giving birth.</p>


             <p><b>What are the symptoms of Period Cramps?</b>Though these symptoms indicate your usual period cramps, don’t delay seeing a doctor if the painful
periods literally prevent you from doing your everyday activities, or the symptoms worsen, or if the pain
has suddenly started after the age of 25. Some of the common symptoms are:
• Excruciating pain in the lower abdomen which moves to your lower back and thighs sometimes
• The pain begins 1-3 days before your period and continues to the first day of your period, slowly
reducing in intensity
• Along with dysmenorrhea, some women may experience nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, and
headache</p>

<p><b>What causes period cramps?</b>
So, this is what it basically is! During your menstrual cycle, the uterus contracts to shed its lining. The
chemicals in your body called prostaglandins trigger the uterus contractions, helping it push out its lining
when you’re menstruating. Higher levels of prostaglandins are associated with unbearable stomach pain
during periods. </p>

<p><b>What do period cramps feel like?</b>
Your uterus is a muscle and while contracting and relaxing, the pain may feel sharp, a pain similar to the
tightening or aching of a muscle or a pain that can be related to a stomach ache. We know it hurts!
Having said that, dysmenorrhea can be uncomfortable but not something that should keep you away
from school or work, and if it does, it is best to consult your doctor.</p>
<p><b>When do we get period cramps?</b>
Menstrual cramps tend to begin 2-3 days before your period, are at their peak during the first two days of
your period, and subside as your period continues.The intensity of your menstrual cramps and your
period symptoms, in general, will vary from month to month.</p>

                <p class="py-4"><b>Abnormal Uterine Bleeding  </b>Abnormally heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding is also called 'abnormal uterine bleeding'. We sometimes use this general term to describe bleeding that does not follow a normal pattern, such as spotting between periods. It used to be referred to as menorrhagia, but this term is no longer used medically.

On average, a typical woman passes around 40 ml of blood during her menstrual period, which lasts around four to seven days. For some women, however, bleeding may be excessively heavy or go on for longer than normal. 

A woman may have 'chronic' heavy or prolonged bleeding (for more than six months) or it may be 'acute' (sudden and severe). In most cases, the causes of abnormal menstrual bleeding are unknown. See your doctor about any abnormal menstrual bleeding.</p>

                <p><b>Causes of abnormal uterine bleeding :</b> 
 Ectopic pregnancy:lodgement of the fertilised egg in the slender fallopian tube instead of the uterine lining
 ,Hormonal disorders : conditions such as hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroxine), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and hyperprolactinemia can disrupt the menstrual cycle
,Ovulatory dysfunction : this is when the ovary does not release an egg each month. Most commonly, this occurs at either end of a woman's reproductive years, either during puberty or at menopause
,Endometriosis : the cells lining the uterus (endometrial cells) can travel to, attach and grow elsewhere in the body, most commonly within the peritoneal cavity (including on the outside of the uterus or on the ovarian surface)
,Infection : including chlamydia or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
,Cancer: most uterine cancers develop in the lining of the uterus, though some cancers grow in the muscle layers of the uterus. They are most common after menopause</p>

<p><b>Treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding</b>
Treatment will depend on the cause, but may include:
 Medication : such as prostaglandin inhibitors, hormone replacement therapy or antibiotics
,Dilatation and curettage (D&C) : involving dilation and gentle scraping of the cervix and the lining of the uterus
,Change of contraception : it may be necessary to explore methods of contraception other than the IUD or hormones
,Surgery : to remove tumours, polyps or fibroids or to treat ectopic pregnancy
,Treatment of underlying disorders : such as hypothyroidism or a bleeding disorder
, Hysterectomy : the removal of the entire uterus is a drastic last resort, generally only considered for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding when a serious disease, such as cancer, is also present</p>
