             <p class="py-4"><b>WHY DO YOU NEED TO HAVE A PERIOD TALK WITH YOUR CHILDREN ?  </b><BR>Most girls have their first periods early during their 6 th or 7th grade. This time is
particularly confusing for them as they navigate adolescence and the changes that
their body is going through. Most children learn about menstruation, and everything
related to the process from their peers and that, understandably, is not a trustworthy
source.<br>
Biology lessons at school too, come much later – around 8 th or 9th grade, meaning
around 71% of the girls have no idea about what’s happening when they get their first
period. Therefore, a preparatory talk about puberty and periods coming from their
mothers can not only address any doubts that they have but also remove the fear and
stigma around periods.</p> </p>

             <p><b>WHEN SHOULD I TALK ABOUT PERIODS ?</b><BR>Girls rarely have their first periods with their mother sitting next to them. Imagine
your daughter at school or out somewhere having a typical day and suddenly noticing
blood from her vagina with no idea of what it is. It is a scary scenario for her as well as
you, having no one around her to help. Thus, having a period talk beforehand is
critical.<BR>

                <p class="py-4"><b>SHOULD YOU DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR SONS AS WELL ? </b> Not talking about periods with our sons and brothers is one of the biggest reasons
behind the long-standing stigma. Having periods is a part of growing up as a woman
and normalizing it is necessary. By discussing periods with your son, you are teaching
them to become empathetic brothers and friends right now and understanding
partners, husbands and dads in the future.
While school teaches them the biology behind menstruation, it is important to teach
them to be kind, patient, attentive and helpful to girls especially during menstruation.
</p>

              <p><b>SHOULD FATHERS BE INCLUDED ?</b>Yes! A father’s role can be of immense help to children during this time. Fathers, like
mothers, are the pillars holding the child’s emotional development and well-being. As
mothers can speak from their experience, fathers can play a big role in normalizing
periods. While mothers can teach and physically prepare their daughters for their first
period by sharing their own experiences, fathers can help them normalize the period
conversation by breaking gender parenting roles.
