It's normal for breast buds to sometimes be very tender or for one breast to start to develop several
months before the other one.
Pubic hair also starts to grow, and some girls may notice more hair on their legs and arms.
</p> </p>

             <p><b>LATER SINGS OF PUBERTY IN GIRLS ?</b><br>• girls' breasts continue to grow and become fuller <br>
• around 2 years after beginning puberty, girls usually have their first period<br>
• pubic hair becomes coarser and curlier<br>
• underarm hair begins to grow – some girls also have hair in other parts of their body, such as
their top lip, and this is completely normal<br>
• girls start to sweat more<br>
• girls often get acne – a skin condition that shows up as different types of spots, including
whiteheads, blackheads and pus-filled spots called pustules<br>
• girls have a white vaginal discharge girls go through a growth spurt – from the time their periods start, girls grow 5 to 7.5cm (2 to 3 inches) annually over the next year or two, then reach their adult height<br>
• most girls gain weight (which is normal) as their body shape changes – girls develop more body
fat along their upper arms, thighs and upper back; their hips grow rounder and their waist gets
narrower</p>

                <p class="py-4"><b>AFTER ABOUT 4 YEARS OF PUBERTY IN GIRLS ?</b><br>• breasts becomes adult-like<br>
• pubic hair has spread to the inner thigh<br>
• genitals should now be fully developed<br>
• girls stop growing taller</p>

              <p><b>MOOD CHANGES IN PUBERTY ?</b>Puberty can be a difficult time for children. They're coping with changes in their body, and possibly acne
or body odour as well, at a time when they feel self-conscious.
Puberty can also be an exciting time, as children develop new emotions and feelings.
But the "emotional rollercoaster" they're on can have psychological and emotional effects, such as:<br>
• unexplained mood swings<br>
• low self-esteem<br>
• aggression<br>
• depression</p>
