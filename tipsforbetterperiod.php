             <p class="py-4"><b>Adequate workout and movement: </b> Yoga is known to have a good effect for regular periods, wherein it improves blood circulation. This is an effective remedy for irregular periods.Exercising keeps your body's metabolic rate at an optimum level. So, go on and try gentle stretches or brisk walking to loosen your muscles and get your blood pumping.</p>


              <p><b>Clothing Choices: </b>It is best to avoid tight clothes or fabric that sticks to your body such as spandex. Soft cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes will help you stay fresh and dry, keeping moisture at bay</p>

<p><b> Frequently change your period products: </b> Never keep on your sanitary pad for longer than recommended. Do not wear it longer than 6-8 hours as it might increase your risk of rashes and infection</p>


<p><b> Enough sleep:</b> Try and get adequate sleep because if your sleep cycle is disrupted, it can severely affect your menstrual cycle. Be sure to get the 7-8-hour sleep for a healthy period.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-12">
<p class="py-4"><b> Healthy eating habits:</b> Unhealthy eating habits lead to hormonal imbalance which in turn is linked to irregular periods. Obesity is a very common reason for a host of problems including skipped or irregular periods, and the primary cause of obesity is unhealthy eating.Increase the intake of whole grains, fruits, and leafy vegetables.</p>

<p><b>Leave stress aside:</b>When you are stressed, your body produces a hormone called cortisol, which is single-handedly enough to disturb estrogen, the female reproductive hormone. As you know estrogen plays a vital role in a healthy period, you must try and calm down and take a deep breath, rather than getting worked up.</p>
<p><b>Physical activity:</b>Most women underestimate the role of physical activity in a smooth, painless menstrual cycle. The physical activity ensures that your hormones stay in balance, and boosts endurance. If you stay active regularly, you are very unlikely to experience pain during menstruation, or irregular, ill-timed cycles.</p>
