             <p class="py-4"><b>SIGNS OF THE FIRST PERIOD?  </b>
The age at which young girls start menstruating can vary widely, with some girls getting their first period as early as 8 years old and others not until they are 15.
 </p>

             <p><b>WHEN DO PERIODS START ?</b>

Periods start during puberty, which is when your body begins to change and become more like an adult. This typically happens between 8 and 14 years old, though puberty is a gradual process that can take years. Periods usually begin around age 12 to 15 for young women, but it’s important to remember that everyone’s body is different.
</p>
            <p><b>HOW MUCH WILL I BLEED ?</b>

Tell your daughter that she is probably losing only a few teaspoons of blood during her period, even though it may seem like more. If she is going through a pad or tampon every hour, though, there may be a problem, and you should talk with her doctor.

</p>
        <p><b>CAN I HAVE SEX WHILE ON MY PERIOD ?</b>

Yes! Having sex on your period is completely safe, and the only real drawback is the mess that might develop as a result.
</p>
        <p><b>CAN I GET PREGNANT WHILE ON MY PERIOD ?</b>
Yes. The highest risk of pregnancy is during ovulation, typically 14 days before your period. Although the risk of getting pregnant is lower on your period, it is still important to use condoms or other methods of birth control to avoid any unintended pregnancies.
</p>

                <p class="py-4"><b>WHY DO GIRLS HAVE PERIODS ? </b> 
Take a positive approach to explaining to your daughter why women have menstrual cycles. Tell her that a menstrual cycle is part of the natural cycle that allows a woman to get pregnant. When a pregnancy doesn't occur in a menstrual cycle, hormones signal her body to shed the baby-ready uterine lining, which is what happens during a period.
</p>

              <p><b>WHY IS MY PERIOD LATE ?</b>
Don’t panic. It is common for periods to come a little earlier or later as not all women have their period every 28 days. A typical cycle is between 21-34 days. Activities that can affect the onset of your cycle are diet, excessive exercise, stress, medication, and several other lifestyle factors. If your period is taking longer than 35 days to occur and you are sexually active, you should take a pregnancy test even if you are on birth control.
</p>
            <p><b>WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT PADS,TAMPONS AND MENSTRUAL CUPS ?</b>
The most common products known as “feminine hygiene products” are pads, tampons, and menstrual cups . All 3 methods help you go about your daily life by collecting the blood released during your period.
</p>
             <p><b>WHAT ARE SIDE-EFFECTS OF GETTING A PERIOD ?</b>
Up to 2 weeks before the start of your period, you might start to notice changes in your body. These symptoms, often referred to as Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), include:
Abdominal cramps , Lower back pain , Headaches , Acne , Fatigue , Swollen or tender breasts , Bloating ,Insomnia , Mood swings.
